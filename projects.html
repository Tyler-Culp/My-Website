        <p>A list of some projects I have done over the last year or so. Here is my <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Tyler-Culp?tab=repositories" target="_blank">Github</a> in case you would like
            to see the source code for a few projects.</p>

            <li><p><b>Marvel Movie Success Predictor</b></p>
            <p>In this project I worked with a team of 5 other people where we tried to discover if there was a way to predict the success of a
                 marvel movie, both critically and commercially, based on general movie statistics like its run time, budget, year released, etc. 
                 This was mainly done with python inside of Jupyter Notebooks where we used libraries like pandas, numpy, patsy, statsmodels, etc.
                 Through this project we found that things like production budget did have a positive correlation with the success of the movie.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Top Spotify Songs</b></p>
                <p>This was a project I worked on last Summer where I attempted to make a Spotify web application that would allow a user to log into
                    their spotify account and then show what their top songs are for all time on the platform. Below is an example of what the page looks like:

                    <img src="spotify_ss2.png" alt="Home page" width="400" height="500">
                    <figcaption>List of top songs the web app shows after log in</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Some third project, haven't decided what to put here yet though.</p>
