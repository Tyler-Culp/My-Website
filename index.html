            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Tyler and I am a third year at <em>UC San Diego</em> where I am pursuing a degree in Mathematics-Computer Science. I was born and raised in Sacramento, California
                where I attended C.K. McClatchy highschool. There I would play baseball and wrestle for all four years. Now that I am in San Diego I love going to Padres games and taking a 
                trip down to the beach every few days!</p>

                <h3>My Journey in Software</h3>
                <p> When entering college at UC San Diego I had no real concept of what software engineering really way. In fact, most things relating to computers were somewhat of a mystery to me.
                    On a whim, I decided to take an intro to programming class at the end of my freshman year and I found that I really enjoyed it. From then on I was hooked, I knew that
                    software was what I wanted to do. I decided to pursue a Mathematics-Computer Science degree the next quarter after that intro class and now two years later, and sevral more computer science classes later,
                    I'm now getting ready to graduate this Spring.

                <h3>My Interests</h3>
                <p> Outside of my school life I enjoy staying active and going to the gym, or going to kickboxing practices. I also like taking advantage of my school's location and visiting the beach as often as possible, usually showing up around
                    sunset and eating my dinner on the beach. Like most people I also love to play my fair share of video games, my favorite being Hollow Knight, and have even tried my hand at developing some games myself.
