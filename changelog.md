Fleshed out paragraphs on index.html page, mainly adding to the "about me" and "my interests" sections. 

Also in index.html I added new borders and background colors for all the main paragraph sections and gave everything a bit more margin to make it so everything wasn't so squished together.

In the projects tab I included a 4th item in the project list (my 110 project) and also made the borders the same size as my home page's to kind of standardize everything.

I also changed one of the pictures at the bottom of the page to be of the new project that I just added. On top of that I also made some adjustments to all of the images heights and widths to try and give it a better flow.
